# agent-lint

**CLI tool for cost estimation and anti-pattern detection in agent workflow YAML configs.**
Catch expensive, fragile, or ungoverned agent workflows before they hit production.

## The Problem

Agent workflows fail in predictable ways: unbounded loops, no retry limits, missing cost guards, parallel branches with no coordination. Most teams find these problems in production — after a $400 API bill or a stuck workflow that ran for six hours.

`agent-lint` finds them at config time.

---

## Install

```bash
pip install agentlinter
```

---

## Usage

```bash
# Lint a single workflow config
agent-lint lint workflow.yaml

# Lint all workflows in a directory, fail CI if score < 80
agent-lint lint workflows/ --fail-under 80

# Estimate token/cost exposure for a workflow
agent-lint estimate workflow.yaml --provider anthropic

# Generate a full audit report
agent-lint lint workflows/ --format markdown
```

---

## What It Detects

**Anti-patterns:**
- Unbounded retry loops (no max_retries or timeout)
- Missing cost guards on high-token operations
- Parallel agent branches with no merge strategy
- Hard-coded API keys in config (security)
- Missing checkpointing on long-running workflows
- Agents with no defined output schema

**Cost estimation:**
- Token budget projection per workflow step
- Worst-case / expected-case / best-case cost ranges
- Model-aware pricing (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini)

**Scoring:**
- 0-100 score per workflow
- Error (-15 pts), warning (-5 pts), info (-1 pt)
- CI integration: `--fail-under` threshold

---

## CI Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/agent-lint.yml
- name: Lint agent workflows
  run: agent-lint lint workflows/ --fail-under 80
```

Treat your agent configs like production code. Gate them the same way.

## Why Static Analysis

No LLM dependency. No API calls. No variance between runs.
Agent configs are deterministic artifacts — they should be audited deterministically.
